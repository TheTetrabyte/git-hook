# Golang Git Hook

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/thetetrabyte/git-hook)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/thetetrabyte/git-hook)

Github Webhook for more control made in Golang

Planning to support other git services in the future, for now it will start will github only.

In the future I will add support for calling external scripts so using this for an auto deploy would be an option

This is still a work in progress
